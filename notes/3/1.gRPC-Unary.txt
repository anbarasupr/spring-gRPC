gRPC-Unary:
-------------

gRPC High Performance ?
--------------------------
	Works on protocol buffers which is faster than json
	Uses Http 2 as underlying transport to send and receive messages
	
Http 1.1:
-----------

	Http 1.1 was released in1997
	Text based protocol to send and receive messages
	TCP Connection - 3 way handshake process
		Significant amount of time is spent in establising a connect
	Serves as One request per Connection model
		For every request, it establishes new connections and the handshake happen
		Takes time in case of large no of concurrrent connections
		
		
		
Http 2:
----------
	Release on 2015 based on Google's SPDY
	Suuports Binary to send and receive messages
	Multiplexing - Multiple request per connections
	
	
Can we use Http2 for Rest:
	Yes. Spring webflux uses Http2 with netty server in Spring Applications
	gRPC has one advantage more than Rest, it has additional communication patterns
	
Webflux Rest uses Http 2 protocol as a underlying model.
gRPC is not tied to Http protocols. Even new protocols introduced, it can uses it as underlying model in future
